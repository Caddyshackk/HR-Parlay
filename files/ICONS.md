# Icon Generation Instructions

## Quick Option: Use Online Tool

1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload the `icon.svg` file
3. Download the generated icons
4. Replace the `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` files

## Alternative: Use favicon.io

1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
2. Upload the `icon.svg` file
3. Generate icons
4. Download and extract
5. Rename the appropriate sizes to match our manifest

## Manual Creation (Any Image Editor)

If you want to create custom icons:
1. Create a 512x512px image with:
   - Background color: #1a1a2e (dark blue)
   - Baseball or HR design
   - Save as icon-512.png

2. Create a 192x192px version and save as icon-192.png

## Temporary Solution

The app works without icons! They just improve the "Add to Home Screen" experience.
For testing, you can skip this step and add the icons later.
