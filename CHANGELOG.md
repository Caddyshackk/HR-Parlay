## 🎯 Pitcher Matchup Integration

### What You See Now:
Each player card shows **opposing pitcher stats:**
- **Pitcher Name** and throwing hand (RHP/LHP)
- **ERA** (color coded: red = bad pitcher, green = good pitcher)
- **HR/9** (Home runs allowed per 9 innings)
  - 2.0+ = 🎯 HR Machine (red = bad for pitcher, good for hitter!)
  - 1.5-2.0 = 🎁 HR Prone
  - 1.0-1.5 = Average
  - Under 1.0 = Tough matchup

### Platoon Advantage
- **⚔️ Advantage** indicator shows when batter has handedness edge
- Left-handed batters vs Right-handed pitchers = advantage
- Right-handed batters vs Left-handed pitchers = advantage
- Switch hitters always have advantage
